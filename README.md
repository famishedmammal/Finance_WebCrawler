# Stock data collector/crawler

### About
My automated Java program that crawls yahoo finance and other business sites for stock prices and industry information for a given list of companies-to-moniter. Stores gathered information into data structures that can be used later by pattern matching AIs. (I have a pattern-based AI for stock trading, that uses this information)
